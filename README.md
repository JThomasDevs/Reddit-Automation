# Reddit Automation

Reddit has increased the cost of its API, causing third-party Reddit apps to shut down. 
Because of this, I have decided to make a Reddit automator using Selenium which can be used to perform a variety of actions on Reddit. 
More features to come.

#### Current Features:
- Login
- Navigate to specified subreddit
- Upvote/Downvote bombs (upvote/downvote every post withing a given range on a subreddit)
