# Reddit Automation

Reddit has increased the cost of its API, causing third-party Reddit apps to shut down. 
Because of this, I have decided to make a Reddit automator using Selenium which can be used to perform a variety of actions on Reddit.
This automator is not intended to share any sort of functionality with the now defunct third party apps but rather to introduce entropy to an unjust system.
More features to come.

### Current Features:
- Login
- Navigate to specified subreddit
- Upvote/Downvote bombs (upvote/downvote every post withing a given range on a subreddit)
